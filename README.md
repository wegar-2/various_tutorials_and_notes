# Various tutorials and notes

This repository contains (actually: is *intended* to contain) notes on various topics that you come across while developing in Python and R.


This repository is meant to be used as an easily accessible reference by the author. It is not meant to contain exhaustive solutions to the problems it covers - just enough to make me tick when I need the solution immediately.
